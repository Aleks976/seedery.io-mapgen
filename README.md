# Plugin Info
A public Oxide plugin for [seedery.io](http://seedery.io)'s Rust map generation.

# [seedery.io](http://seedery.io) [WIP]
[seedery.io](http://seedery.io) is a free, automated map generation service. The aim of the service is to provide an easy way to filter through different types of maps (seeds), based on a number of parameters, including map size, terrain height and monument count.

# Usage
Just pop `SeederyIoMapGen.cs` in your `plugins` folder, and it'll generate a map.

Check the *Releases* page of for a pre-built version of a simple web server, which allows you to save both the map and monument data (since plugins can't save these directly).

Alternatively you can compile it from source, as long as you change the reference paths.
